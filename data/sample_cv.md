## Work Experience

### Senior Software Engineer — NovaTech Solutions (2021 – Present)

- Led the re-architecture of the data ingestion platform from a monolith to an
  event-driven microservices topology (Kafka + FastAPI), cutting P95 latency from
  1 200 ms to 180 ms.
- Designed and shipped an internal RAG chatbot (LangChain + pgvector) that reduced
  onboarding time for new hires by 35 % by surfacing institutional knowledge.
- Mentored a team of 4 junior engineers, introduced pair-programming rotations, and
  raised unit test coverage from 42 % to 87 % in 6 months.
- Established GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines with automated security scans (Trivy,
  Bandit) and zero-downtime Kubernetes rolling deployments.
- Stack: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, GCP.

### Software Engineer — BlueWave Analytics (2018 – 2021)

- Built a real-time anomaly-detection service processing 500 K events/sec using
  Apache Flink and a custom ML model (scikit-learn + ONNX Runtime).
- Developed a self-service BI dashboard (React + D3.js + REST API) used by
  150 internal analysts, eliminating a 3-day manual reporting cycle.
- Integrated third-party payment providers (Stripe, PayPal) for a SaaS billing
  module, handling PCI-DSS compliance requirements.
- Stack: Python, Java, React, PostgreSQL, AWS (Lambda, SQS, RDS).

### Junior Developer — CodeCraft Studio (2016 – 2018)

- Maintained and extended a legacy PHP CMS, gradually migrating features to a
  RESTful Django backend.
